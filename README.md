# Unacknowledged Scrolls Reporter (Discord)

Find all Discord messages in the last _N_ hours containing the üìú emoji where no configured acknowledger has reacted with ‚úÖ, then post jump links (as buttons) into a channel.

## What it does

- Scans all text channels + threads (including archived public threads) in one guild.
- Matches Unicode üìú by default; can also match a server custom emoji via `CUSTOM_SCROLL_ID`.
- For each match, verifies none of the configured acknowledgers have added a ‚úÖ reaction.
- Posts an embed + link buttons directly in your chosen report channel.
- Runs in GitHub Actions on a schedule or manually.

## Setup

1. **Create a Discord bot**

   - In the Developer Portal, enable **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**.
   - Invite the bot to your server with at least:
     - _View Channels_, _Read Message History_ (server-wide for areas you want scanned)
     - _Send Messages_, _Embed Links_ (in the report channel)

2. **Repo secrets (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions)**

   - `DISCORD_TOKEN` ‚Äì Bot token
   - `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` ‚Äì Guild (server) ID
   - `DISCORD_ACK_USER_IDS` ‚Äì Comma-separated Discord user IDs allowed to acknowledge with ‚úÖ (required)
   - `REPORT_CHANNEL_ID` ‚Äì Channel (or thread) ID to receive reports
   - _(Optional)_ `CUSTOM_SCROLL_ID` ‚Äì Numeric ID of a custom `:scroll:` emoji

3. **Repo variables (Settings ‚Üí Variables)**

   - _(Optional)_ `SCROLL_UNICODE` ‚Äì Defaults to üìú
   - _(Optional)_ `CHECK_UNICODE` ‚Äì Defaults to ‚úÖ
   - _(Optional)_ `ALLOW_CHANNEL_IDS` ‚Äì Comma-separated channel IDs to scan
   - _(Optional)_ `ALLOW_CATEGORY_IDS` ‚Äì Comma-separated category IDs to scan
   - _(Optional)_ `MAX_RESULTS` ‚Äì Safety cap (default 500)

4. **Schedule**
   - The workflow runs daily at 16:00 UTC (‚âà 9:00 AM PT). Edit cron as needed.

## Manual run (override)

- In the Actions tab ‚Üí **Unacknowledged Scrolls Report** ‚Üí **Run workflow**
  - `window_hours` (e.g., `6`, `24`, `48`)
  - `report_channel_id` override (leave blank to use secret)
  - `include_bots` (`true`/`false`)
  - `dry_run` (`true`/`false`) ‚Äî don't post, only log the results

## Local testing

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r bot/requirements.txt
export DISCORD_TOKEN=... \
       DISCORD_GUILD_ID=... \
   DISCORD_ACK_USER_IDS=111111111111111111,222222222222222222 \
       REPORT_CHANNEL_ID=... \
       WINDOW_HOURS=24 \
       DRY_RUN=true
python bot/report.py
```

Notes

    Private archived threads require appropriate permissions (and code change to fetch private=True).

    If your server uses a custom :scroll: emoji, set CUSTOM_SCROLL_ID to its numeric ID.

    To include bot-authored messages, set INCLUDE_BOTS=true.

## Acceptance criteria (so Copilot knows when it‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù)

- [ ] Workflow `unack_scrolls.yml` exists and runs on schedule + manual.
- [ ] Script logs in, scans last `WINDOW_HOURS`, and **posts link-button batches** to `REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`.
- [ ] Matches **Unicode üìú** and (if provided) **`CUSTOM_SCROLL_ID`** occurrences.
- [ ] Correctly **excludes** messages already reacted to with ‚úÖ by any ID in **`DISCORD_ACK_USER_IDS`**.
- [ ] Respects allowlists (`ALLOW_CHANNEL_IDS`, `ALLOW_CATEGORY_IDS`) if set.
- [ ] No CSV files; output is **embed + buttons only**.
- [ ] Gracefully skips channels without permission and survives HTTP hiccups.
- [ ] Works from a cold start in GitHub Actions (no long-lived process).

If you want me to pre-fill your IDs and cron in these files before you paste them into the repo, just drop the values and I‚Äôll slot them in.
